# Blackjack game
Blackjack is a program that allows a human user to play a simplified version of Blackjack against a computer opponent.

## The simplified blackjack rules

* Draw two cards for the player and display them.
* Draw two cards for the "dealer" and display one of them, keeping the other one hidden.
* Allow the player to "hit" as many times as he would like.
* If the player "busts" (gets a total over 21), the dealer automatically wins.
* Allow the dealer to hit as many times as he would like. Dealer should probably hit on sixteen or lower.
* If the dealer busts, the player automatically wins.
* Assuming no one has busted, the player with the highest total wins.
